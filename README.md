The previous version of the pombe app can be downloaded here [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maku.pombe).

Pombe is a sample cocktail app, built with [Jetpack Compose][compose]. The goal of the app is to
showcase how parts of clean architecture components work together. Its also a playground to experiment
with different technologies and collaborate wth other awesome android devs.

To try out this app, you need to use
[Android Studio BumbleBee](https://developer.android.com/studio).
You can clone this repository, build and run it.

### Status: ðŸš§ In progress ðŸš§

Pombe is still in the early stages of development, and as such only three screens have been created
so far. However, most of the app's architecture has been implemented, as well as the domain layer,
data layer, presentation layers, and early stages of jetpack compose UI.

## Features

- __Home__, shows a filter row, latest and popular cocktail lists
  - __Filter__, allowing the user to filter the cocktails according to category
  - __Latest & Popular lists__, show the user a list of cocktails.
  - __Search__, allow users to search for specific cocktail.

## Architecture
- The app has a screaming architecture and is packaged by layered features.
- Each feature has a domain and presentation layer. In each presentation layer, youll find a [Viewtate][viewstate], [Event][event] and [ViewModel][viewmodel] file.
- In the domain layer, we have modeled the domain according to feature. As for this particular app, we have actually reused some data classes, since the the [Pojos][pojos] are the same accross cartain features.
- Special feature like the filter chips fetch data from the [RoomDB][roomdb], which comes auto populated with the different categories. This is so because creating an api end point for the using [Retrofi][retrofit] is redundant and creates technical debt.
- The app is built in a Redux-style, where each UI 'screen' / feature has its own [ViewModel][viewmodel], which depends on a feature view state.
- Each (ViewModel)[viewmodel] is responsible for subscribing to any data streams, in this case the the use-cases, required for the view, as well as exposing functions which allow the UI to send events.

## Data

### Cocktails data

The cocktail data is fetched from the [CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

The [`DrinkRepository`][drinkrepository] class is responsible for handling the data fetching of all cocktail information:

 - Each cocktail is fetched using [OkHttp][okhttp], and then parsed using [Gson][gson].
 - The parsed entities are then added to the local data stores: [`RoomCache`][roomcache], for storage in the local [Room][room] [`PombeDatabase`][db] database.
